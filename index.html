        <p id="about">
            <h2>More About Me:</h2>
            I am Eldad David Ng'ang'a. A current student of <em>Moringa School</em>. 
            I joined the school to learn about software development. I had the argue to always 
            work with computers from quite a young age mostly due to my brother's influence.
            I am an introvert who loves coding and Moringa School enables me to be more and helps 
            me to go that extra mile in becoming a software developer. So far i am enjoying my stay 
            at the school as it has enabled me to create such a webpage after just one week. I love 
            being challenged and it has given me quite the challanges. I am fresh from High School 
            thus i have no job experience yet.
